express-template
================

Here is a basic template to get started writing reasonably well featured web app.

Comes with:

- Basic controllers
- Enhanced error handling over `errorHandler` middleware
- `mongoose` as a Mongo DB ORM
- Express sessions
- Cluster
- REPL servers for each worker ready for awesome socat action
- `microtest` and almost full test coverage; up to you to keep test coverage high

You will need

- A redis server
- A mongo server if working with models

To get started

    npm install
    path/to/redis-server
    path/to/mongod
    node server.js

Then you can hack away at the code.
